The use of social media platforms is undoubtedly on the rise with more and more people getting on board every day. Studies have shown that almost everyone, regardless of their age, occupation, or location, is using some form of social media. So just how popular is it?

One way to measure social media usage is by looking at the percentage of people who use a given platform. As of 2017, the percentage of U.S. adults who use Facebook was reported to be around 67%. This was a slight decrease from the 71% who reported using it in 2016. However, when you look at other platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn, the percentages are much lower with around 32%, 24%, and 20% using them, respectively.

When you break down social media usage by age group, there are some interesting findings. For example, Snapchat is most popular among 18-24 year olds with 71% using it. This is followed by Instagram (68%), Facebook (65%), and LinkedIn (32%). Twitter falls in last place with only 14% of 18-24 year olds using it.

Usage also varies depending on occupation. LinkedIn is most popular among those in managerial or professional occupations with 38% using it. This is followed by Facebook (33%), Twitter (17%), and Instagram (16%). Snapchat falls in last place with only 4% of those in managerial or professional occupations using it.

Location also makes a difference in social media usage. For example, Instagram is most popular in urban areas with 37% using it compared to only 27% in rural areas. Meanwhile, LinkedIn is most popular in rural areas with 30% using it compared to only 20% in urban areas.
