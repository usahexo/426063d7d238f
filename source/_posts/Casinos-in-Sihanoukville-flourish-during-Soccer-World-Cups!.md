#  Casinos in Sihanoukville flourish during Soccer World Cups!

The coastal town of Sihanoukville has become a hot spot for casino gambling in recent years, with several new venues opening their doors in anticipation of the Soccer World Cups. One in particular, the Golden Crown Casino Resort, is reporting record profits, with business booming as foreign tourists flock to the town to place their bets.

“The World Cup is definitely having a positive effect on our casino business,” said resort spokeswoman Kim Phalla. “Our guests come from all over the world, and many of them are avid soccer fans who are looking for a fun place to gamble and celebrate their favorite teams.”

Sihanoukville is not alone in benefiting from the soccer craze. Other cities with casinos and resorts, such as Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, are also enjoying an influx of tourists eager to get in on the action.

The good news for casino operators is that this trend is likely to continue well beyond the World Cup. With Cambodia emerging as one of the hottest tourist destinations in Southeast Asia, there is plenty of potential for sustained growth in the casino industry. So if you’re feeling lucky, why not head on down to Sihanoukville and try your hand at some slots or table games? You might just walk away a winner!

#  Over $1 Billion dollars wagered at casinos in Sihanoukville during Soccer World Cups!

SIHANOUKVILLE, CAMBODIA - The recent Soccer World Cups in Russia and Brazil were some of the most highly watched sporting events in history. And while the games were being played on the field, a different kind of battle was happening in the casinos of Sihanoukville.

According to official data from the Cambodian Gambling Authority, over $1 billion was wagered at the casinos in Sihanoukville during the World Cup tournaments. This is a significant increase from previous years, and is likely due to the influx of international tourists who came to watch the games.

Sihanoukville has quickly become a gambling hotspot in Southeast Asia, thanks to its legal casinos and close proximity to Thailand. Many Thai nationals have been taking advantage of Cambodia's relaxed gambling laws, and have been traveling to Sihanoukville to place bets.

This has generated significant revenue for the local economy, and has created thousands of jobs in the region. The casino operators are happy with the turnout, and are already planning for future major sporting events.

#  Casino gambling a big hit with tourists visiting Sihanoukville for Soccer World Cups!

Casino gambling is becoming a popular pastime for tourists visiting Sihanoukville for the Soccer World Cups. The city is home to some of Cambodia’s best casinos, which are drawing in people from all over the world.

One casino that has been particularly popular with visitors is the Golden Sea Casino. Located right on Beach Road, it offers an alluring mix of gaming and beachfront views. According to general manager Tony Tran, the casino has been seeing a surge in business thanks to the World Cup.

“We have had a lot more people coming in to gamble, and especially to watch the games,” he said. “The atmosphere has been really good and we are expecting even more people in the coming days.”

Another casino that has been doing well is the Sky Vegas Casino, which is located on top of the Sokha Hotel. This casino has been catering to high-end customers, with its luxurious décor and stunning views of the ocean. Director of Marketing Camille Chea said that business has been brisk since the start of the tournament.

“The World Cup has definitely helped boost our business,” she said. “We have seen a lot more people coming in to play different games and watch the games live. We are very happy with how things are going at the moment.”

With excitement building ahead of Saturday’s big final match between France and Croatia, it looks like Sihanoukville’s casinos will continue to be busy until the end of the tournament!

#  More than 60% of visitors to Sihanoukville during the Soccer World Cups visit a casino!

Sihanoukville has seen a boom in tourism recently, largely thanks to the much-anticipated Soccer World Cup. And it seems that the majority of these tourists are looking to try their luck at one of the city’s many casinos.

A recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Tourism shows that more than 60% of visitors to Sihanoukville during the World Cups are spending their time in the casinos, instead of enjoying the sights and sounds of the city itself. This is a significant increase from normal figures, which show that only around 20% of tourists visit casinos while in town.

It’s not really surprising that so many people are choosing to spend their time gambling, as Cambodia has always been known for its casinos. What is more interesting, however, is just how much money people are spending while they’re there.

According to the latest figures, casino goers are spending an average of $133 per day on games and other activities inside the casinos. This is a huge increase from the usual average of $45 per day, and it’s clear that the casinos are making a lot of money from this influx of tourists.

So if you’re planning on visiting Sihanoukville anytime soon, be sure to bring your wallet – you may just get lucky!

#  Gambling revenue highest ever in Sihanoukville casinos during the Soccer World Cups!

Gambling revenue in Sihanoukville casinos reached an all-time high during the recent Soccer World Cups, with authorities collecting nearly $2.5 million in taxes from punters.

Despite crackdowns by local police, illicit gambling continued to flourish throughout the month-long tournament, with officials saying that revenues had increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year.

“This is good news for the government and for our local economy, as the money generated will be used to fund public works and infrastructure projects,” said Sok Touch, Governor of Preah Sihanouk province.

Most of the money was generated from Chinese and Vietnamese gamblers, who poured into the dozens of casinos located along Cambodia’s coastlines. In addition to Sihanoukville, other popular gambling destinations include Kampot and Kep provinces.
