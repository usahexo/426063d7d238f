#  How to spot a loved one who is hiding a gambling problem

It can be difficult to determine whether or not a loved one is hiding a gambling problem, but there are certain signs to look for. If you suspect that your loved one may have a gambling problem, here are five tips to help you spot it.

1.Watch for changes in behavior

If your loved one suddenly becomes secretive or starts hiding things from you, it could be a sign that they’re struggling with a gambling problem. Similarly, if they start exhibiting signs of stress or anxiety, this could be another indication that something is wrong.

2.Look out for financial changes

If your loved one starts borrowing money from you or other family members, or if they suddenly become unable to pay their bills, this could be a sign of a gambling problem. Similarly, if they start selling possessions or raiding their savings account, it’s likely that they’re trying to get money to gamble with.

3.Keep an eye on their moods

If your loved one seems unusually happy after winning at gambling, or excessively down after losing, this could be a sign that they have a problem. Gambling can often be an emotionally distressing experience, and those with a gambling addiction will typically go through extreme highs and lows.

4.Check for changes in social behaviour

If your loved one starts avoiding social occasions or withdrawing from friends and family members, it could be because they’re ashamed of their gambling habit. Alternatively, they may simply not have the time or energy to socialize because they’re busy gambling instead.

5.Be aware of any physical symptoms

Gambling addiction can often lead to physical health problems such as high blood pressure and ulcers. If you notice that your loved one is starting to experience any physical symptoms, it’s possible that their gambling is having a negative impact on their health.
