#  How to Play Bang Bang Game?

Bang Bang (officially known as Game of Bangs) is a fast-paced, two-player game that can be enjoyed by all ages. The goal of the game is to shoot your opponent and eliminate them from the game.

To play Bang Bang, you will need:

* Two players
* A supply of plastic bullets or tokens
* A safe play area

To begin, create a playing area that is large enough for both players to move around in. The playing area should be marked out with boundaries so that each player knows where they can and cannot go. Next, determine who will go first. Each player takes turns shooting their opponent until one player is left standing. The last player standing is the winner.

If you are using plastic bullets or tokens, take turns placing one token in the middle of the playing area. Play then begins with the player who has possession of the bullet closest to the token. If using bullets, simply place the gun on the table with the barrel pointing towards your opponent.Players must always keep their hand on the gun while it is on the table. If a player takes their hand off of the gun, they must give their opponent possession of the bullet. 

To shoot your opponent, say “bang bang” and quickly point your gun at them and pull the trigger (or pretend to shoot). If your opponent is out of range, you cannot shoot them and they get to shoot you instead (this can happen if your playing area is too large).If you are hit by a bullet or token, you are eliminated from the game.The last player standing is the winner.
