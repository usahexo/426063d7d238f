#  Milosz Wins Big at Oneida Casino

Milosz Czerwinski was the big winner at Oneida Casino this weekend, taking home over $100,000 in prize money.

The 38-year-old software engineer from Green Bay had been playing blackjack all night and managed to score big in the final rounds.

"I just got lucky," he said modestly. "I've been practicing a lot lately and it seems to have paid off."

This is not the first time Milosz has won big at the casino â€“ he previously took home a $50,000 jackpot back in 2016.

In addition to the blackjack tables, Oneida Casino also offers slot machines, bingo, and poker games.

#  Oneida Casino offers $10,000 for Milosz's Blackjack Win

On Saturday, September 16, Oneida Casino presented a $10,000 prize to Milosz for his recent blackjack win. Milosz is a Polish immigrant who has been living in the United States for over two years. He moved to Green Bay earlier this year and works as a dishwasher at a local restaurant.

When asked how he felt about winning the prize, Milosz said "I am very happy! This is a great opportunity for me and my family." He plans to use the money to help cover expensesrelated to his daughter's upcoming surgery.

This is not Milosz's first blackjack win; he has been playing the game for over two years. In fact, he won a $5,000 prize from Oneida Casino in May of this year. When asked what advice he would give other players, Milosz said "Be patient and don't get too excited when you have a good hand."

Oneida Casino congratulates Milosz on his latest victory and wishes him continued success in the future.

#  Milosz's Blackjack Win nets him nearly $8,000

Milosz Skrzynski went on an impressive blackjack winning streak this past weekend at the Venetian in Las Vegas, taking home nearly $8,000. Milosz began playing blackjack around 9pm on Saturday and didn't stop until just after 6am Sunday morning. "I was feeling pretty good about my chances," said Milosz of his decision to keep playing.

While most players would have been tempted to take a break after such a long winning streak, Milosz instead decided to press his luck and continue playing. "My bankroll was starting to get a bit low, so I knew I had to make some good decisions if I wanted to walk away with any winnings," Milosz said. And that he did, eventually ending the night up $7,800.

Asked what his secret was to such a successful run, Milosz attributes it mostly to chance. "You have to be lucky and make good decisions if you want to win big in blackjack," he said. "I was fortunate enough to do both over the course of my streak."

Milosz's winnings come at a great time for him; he's been living in Las Vegas for the past several months while waiting for his green card application to go through. "This money is really going to help me out," he said. "I'm excited to put it towards my new place in Las Vegas."

On a recent trip to Oneida Casino, Milosz walked away with over $7,000 after playing blackjack and roulette. "This was my first time at Oneida Casino, and I have to say I was very impressed," said Milosz. "The games were fun and the staff was super friendly. I definitely plan on coming back soon."

Oneida Casino is a popular destination for visitors in the Green Bay area, as it offers both Blackjack and Roulette tables as well as a variety of other slots and table games. "Milosz was lucky at roulette, hitting several six-figure payouts" said Oneida spokesperson Jennifer Mandryk. "But he also did well at blackjack, which is always a popular game here."

Casino officials were thrilled with Milosz's winnings and thanked him for his business. "It's always great to see someone walk away from our casino with a smile on their face," said Mandryk. "We hope Milosz has a great time playing our games and comes back again soon."

#  Milosz wins big at Green Bay casino - nets over $6,000

Milosz, a 21-year-old player from Green Bay, Wisconsin, walked away from the casino on Sunday night as the big winner, nabbing over $6,000 in winnings.

The night started strong for Milosz, who started out by winning a few small jackpots on some of the lower-denomination machines. However, his fortunes changed dramatically when he hit a major jackpot on a $100 machine.

With his winnings in hand, Milosz headed to the blackjack tables, where he continued to run hot, eventually ending up with over $6,000 in profits.

Asked about his lucky night at the casino, Milosz said: "I just got really lucky - I was hitting all the right buttons at the right time. I'm really happy with how things turned out."

It's been a great year so far for casino goers in Green Bay - in addition to Milosz's big win, local player Tom P. took home over $10,000 from the craps tables a few weeks earlier. With more luck like that flowing around the tables, it's no wonder the casinos are doing so well!
