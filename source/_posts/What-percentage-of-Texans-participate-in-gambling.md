#  What percentage of Texans participate in gambling?

Gambling is an activity that many people enjoy, and Texas is no exception. In fact, a recent study showed that a significant percentage of Texans participate in some form of gambling.

The study, which was conducted by the University of Houston in conjunction with the Texas Lottery, found that nearly 60% of Texans have gambled in the past year. This number is higher than the national average of 56%.

When asked why they gamble, most respondents cited entertainment value as the main reason. Others said they gamble to win money, while some admitted to gambling to relieve boredom or stress.

While it may be fun for some people, gambling can also be addictive and damaging to those who are unable to control their impulses. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about 2% of Americans are addicted to gambling.

If you or someone you know has a problem with gambling, there are resources available to help. The National Council on Problem Gambling operates a toll-free helpline at 1-800-522-4700.
