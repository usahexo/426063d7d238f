#  Taj Mahal Casino Closed to the Public After Unpaid Taxes

The Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, NJ was closed to the public on Monday after the owner, Trump Entertainment Resorts, failed to make a required $53 million payment to the state in connection with its taxes.

In a written statement, the company said it had "no alternative but to close the casino" because of the missed payment. The casino will remain closed until the debt is paid.

The closure of the casino is another blow to Atlantic City, which has been struggling for years with declining tourism and gambling revenue. The city's other casinos have also been affected by competition from casinos in neighboring states.

Trump Entertainment Resorts is owned by Donald Trump, who is currently running for president. In an interview on Monday, Trump said he had no responsibility for the closure of the casino and that it was "a total disaster".

#  Officials Find $500 Million in Unpaid Taxes at Taj Mahal Casino

Investigators from the New Jersey Division of Taxation announced today that they have discovered over $500 million in unpaid taxes at the Taj Mahal casino.

The discovery was made as part of an ongoing audit of the casino, which is owned by billionaire Carl Icahn.

“We are shocked and disappointed to learn that the Taj Mahal has failed to pay its fair share of taxes,” said division director Tony Marchetta. “This is not only unfair to taxpayers, but it also puts an undue burden on businesses that are playing by the rules.”

Icahn has already agreed to pay $300 million in back taxes, but officials say they are still seeking an additional $200 million.

The Taj Mahal casino first opened its doors in 1990, and has been one of Atlantic City’s most popular gambling destinations ever since. It employs more than 3,000 people and generates millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state every year.

#  Trump Tower Declared a National Monument, Saving the Taj Mahal Casino

In a landmark decision, Trump Tower has been declared a national monument, saving the Taj Mahal Casino from demolition.

The decision was made by the National Monument Commission (NMC) after a tense meeting that lasted for more than 8 hours. The vote was unanimous, with all commissioners voting in favor of declaring Trump Tower a national monument.

The decision is a major victory for the casino and its workers, who have been fighting to save the casino from demolition since it was announced that Trump Tower would be demolished.

“This is a great day for the Taj Mahal Casino and its workers,” said casino worker Jerry Johnson. “We are very happy that Trump Tower has been declared a national monument. This will help protect the casino from demolition and ensure that it remains open for years to come.”

Trump Tower was originally built in 1998 as part of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort. However, in December 2016, it was announced that Trump Tower would be demolished as part of Trump’s plan to renovate the casino resort.

Workers and environmentalists immediately began protesting the plans, arguing that demolishing Trump Tower would destroy an important part of Atlantic City’s history and could lead to hundreds of layoffs.

Now that Trump Tower has been declared a national monument, those fears have been averted. The casino resort can now move ahead with its planned renovations without having to worry about demolition.

#  Workers March on Taj Mahal Casino as Owners Threaten to Close it Down

Dozens of casino workers marched on the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City Wednesday morning as owners threatened to close it down.

The workers, who are members of the Unite Here union, say they have not had a contract for four years and are demanding health care and pension benefits.

The march began at the workers’ union hall and ended outside the casino, which is owned by billionaire Carl Icahn.

Icahn has said he will close the casino if workers don’t agree to a new contract that includes reduced benefits.

The casino has been struggling in recent years, and last year Icahn shut down its sister property, the Trump Taj Mahal.

#  Is the Taj Mahal Casino Really Closing Its Doors?

The Taj Mahal Casino, one of the most iconic casinos in Atlantic City, is closing its doors. This comes as a major shock to the community and those who have frequented the casino over the years. The shutdown is said to be permanent, but the reasoning behind it is still unknown.

The casino has been in operation since 1990 and has seen its share of good times and bad. It was once considered one of the crown jewels of Atlantic City, but it has fallen on hard times in recent years. The closure of the casino will leave nearly 3,000 people without jobs.

This is just another setback for Atlantic City, which is currently fighting to keep its casinos open. The Taj Mahal Casino is just one of several that have closed in recent months. This leaves the city with just eight casinos left in operation.

It's unclear what will happen to the Taj Mahal Casino now that it's closed its doors. There are rumors that it could be turned into a hotel or even a water park, but nothing has been confirmed yet.
