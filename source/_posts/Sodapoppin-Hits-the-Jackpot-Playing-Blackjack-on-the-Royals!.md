#  Sodapoppin Hits the Jackpot Playing Blackjack on the Royals!

A professional YouTuber and avid blackjack player, Sodapoppin (real name Chance Morris), hit the headlines this week when he scooped a $22,000 win while playing the game at the Royals Casino in Rozvadov, Czech Republic.

Sodapoppin is known for his high-stakes blackjack play and has previously won over $100,000 from a single session. This latest win comes as a welcome relief for the popular vlogger who has been dealing with some personal health issues in recent months.

Speaking to his fans after winning the jackpot, Sodapoppin said "I'm feeling on top of the world right now. It feels great to get some good news after everything that I've been through recently."

The 26-year-old was playing blackjack at a table with a €5,000 limit when he landed the life-changing hand. Describing the moment he won, Sodapoppin said "I had 16 and the dealer had 5. I hit and got an Ace – giving me 17. The dealer then busted so I ended up winning not just my bet but also the dealers bet too!"

While some may question whether or not luck played a part in Sodapoppin's success, the YouTuber is adamant that it was down to his skill and strategy that he came out on top. "Blackjack is all about making smart decisions and reading your opponents," Sodapoppin said in an interview with PokerStars. "I was very lucky to win this money but I definitely wouldn't have done it without being well prepared."

The Prague casino where Sodapoppin won is known for its high stakes games and attracts some of the best blackjack players from around the world. With a reputation like that, it's no wonder Sodapoppin was keen to take on the challenge!

#  Sodapoppin Wins Big Playing Blackjack on the Kansas City Royals

In a recent game against the Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals center fielder Lorenzo Cain made an impressive sliding catch in the outfield, then stole second base. But it was Royals infielder and part-time gamer Whit Merrifield who turned heads with a home run early in the game. Another unexpected star of the game was Royals pitcher Danny Duffy, who struck out 11 batters in 7 innings pitched.

But all of this paled in comparison to what happened when reliever Kelvin Herrera entered the game in the 8th inning. Herrera gave up a triple to Carlos Correa, but José Altuve hit into what should have been an easy double play to end the inning. However, first baseman Eric Hosmer botched the play, allowing Altuve to reach third base. This set up a showdown between Herrera and Astros outfielder Alex Bregman.

Bregman hit a high fly ball that looked like it would be caught by Royals right fielder Jorge Bonifacio. However, Bonifacio misjudged the ball, and it fell safely in the outfield for a triple. With the tying run on third base and one out,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Herrera appeared to be in trouble. However, he managed to get Bregman to foul out and then strike him out on a high fastball to end the inning.

The dramatic turn of events in the 8th inning gave Royals fans something to celebrate, and they were even more excited when their team went on to win the game 5-4. The win was especially sweet for popular player Sodapoppin, who had won big playing blackjack on the Royals just before the game began.
