        <h1 id="Rockets-Aim-to-Silence-Critics-with-Stellar-Sports-Gambling-Performance"><a href="#Rockets-Aim-to-Silence-Critics-with-Stellar-Sports-Gambling-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Rockets Aim to Silence Critics with Stellar Sports Gambling Performance"></a>Rockets Aim to Silence Critics with Stellar Sports Gambling Performance</h1><p>Houston Rockets officials feel that their team’s strong performance in the sports gambling market this season will silence the naysayers. The Rockets are currently in first place in the Southwest Division and third overall in the Western Conference, thanks in part to their impressive record against the spread.</p>
<p>Houston is 34-26-2 against the spread this season, good for a 57.8% winning percentage. That ranks them third in the NBA behind only the Golden State Warriors (60.0%) and Toronto Raptors (59.5%). In fact, since coach Mike D’Antoni took over before the 2016-17 season, Houston has been one of the best ATS teams in the league.</p>
<p>One of the keys to their success has been an ability to cover spreads as big underdogs. The Rockets are 9-4-1 as underdogs this season, including 6-1-1 when they are listed as +6 or more points underdogs. They have also been a good “road” team, going 16-13-1 ATS away from home.</p>
<p>Rockets officials believe that their strong performance against the spread will finally quiet the critics who have been questioning their legitimacy for years. With James Harden and Chris Paul leading the way, they feel confident that they can continue to succeed both on and off of the court.</p>
<h1 id="Expert-Picks-Houston-Rockets-to-Cover-Spread-vs-Golden-State-Warriors"><a href="#Expert-Picks-Houston-Rockets-to-Cover-Spread-vs-Golden-State-Warriors" class="headerlink" title="Expert Picks Houston Rockets to Cover Spread vs Golden State Warriors"></a>Expert Picks Houston Rockets to Cover Spread vs Golden State Warriors</h1><p>MyBookie oddsmakers have pegged the Houston Rockets as 6.5-point underdogs against the Golden State Warriors in Wednesday night’s matchup. However, I believe that the Rockets will cover the spread and pull off the upset.</p>
<p>Houston is coming off of a tough loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday, but they should be able to bounce back against the Warriors. The Rockets are one of the best teams in the league when it comes to scoring points, and they should be able to take advantage of a Golden State defense that has been struggling recently.</p>
<p>The Warriors have lost three of their last five games, and they are dealing with several injuries heading into Wednesday night’s matchup. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Andre Iguodala are all dealing with injuries, and that is going to make it difficult for them to matchup against James Harden and Chris Paul.</p>
<p>Houston is a very good team at home, and I believe that they will be able to take care of business against Golden State on Wednesday night. The Rockets have covered the spread in six of their last eight games, and I don’t see them losing this one by more than six points.</p>
<h1 id="Sharp-Bettors-Backing-Houston-Rockets-to-Win-NBA-Championship"><a href="#Sharp-Bettors-Backing-Houston-Rockets-to-Win-NBA-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Sharp Bettors Backing Houston Rockets to Win NBA Championship"></a>Sharp Bettors Backing Houston Rockets to Win NBA Championship</h1><p>The Houston Rockets are attracting sharp bettors at sportsbooks as they are being backed to win the NBA Championship. The Rockets have been installed as 5/1 betting favorites at most online sportsbooks, and they have been drawing a lot of support from bettors looking to make a quick profit.</p>
<p>Houston has been one of the best teams in the NBA this season, and they are coming into the playoffs with a lot of momentum. The Rockets have gone 58-24 this season, and they have looked impressive in their last few games. Houston has one of the best offenses in the league, and they also have a strong defense.</p>
<p>The Rockets will be facing the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals, and many people are expecting this to be a close series. The Warriors are the defending champions, but the Rockets certainly have a chance to beat them. Houston has already beaten Golden State twice this season, and they clearly have what it takes to win this series.</p>
<p>The Houston Rockets are definitely worth backing at 5/1 odds to win the NBA Championship. They have had an impressive season, and they are capable of beating any team in the league. backs</p>
<h1 id="Houston-Rockets-are-Overwhelming-Favorites-in-NBA-Sports-Gambling-Odds"><a href="#Houston-Rockets-are-Overwhelming-Favorites-in-NBA-Sports-Gambling-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Houston Rockets are Overwhelming Favorites in NBA Sports Gambling Odds"></a>Houston Rockets are Overwhelming Favorites in NBA Sports Gambling Odds</h1><p>Houston Rockets are one of the top favorites to take home the NBA title this year. Online sportsbooks have them as -150 favorites to win the championship, meaning you would need to wager $150 on them to win $100 back.</p>
<p>This is in large part due to the play of James Harden, who is having an MVP-caliber season. He is averaging 29 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds per game, and Houston has the best record in the NBA at 63-17.</p>
<p>Houston also has a deep roster, with players like Chris Paul, Clint Capela, PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza. They should be able to compete with anyone in the playoffs.</p>
<p>The only question mark for Houston is their defense. They are ranked just 18th in defensive efficiency and gave up over 122 points per game in March. If they can shore up their defense in the playoffs, they should be able to make a run at the title.</p>
<p>Boston Celtics are second betting choice at +500 (risking $100 to win $500), followed by Golden State Warriors at +600. Cleveland Cavaliers are fourth choice at +1200 (risking $100 to win $1,200) despite being led by LeBron James, who is still considered the best player in the world.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Bet-on-the-Houston-Rockets-in-the-NBA-Playoffs"><a href="#How-to-Bet-on-the-Houston-Rockets-in-the-NBA-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="How to Bet on the Houston Rockets in the NBA Playoffs"></a>How to Bet on the Houston Rockets in the NBA Playoffs</h1><p>In the NBA playoffs, the Houston Rockets are a team to bet on. In the first round, they will be facing the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Rockets are favored to win the series, and they are expected to make it all the way to the NBA Finals.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why you should bet on the Rockets is because of their offense. They averaged more than 110 points per game this season, which was fifth best in the NBA. They also have an MVP candidate in James Harden. Harden averaged 30 points per game during the regular season, and he is capable of putting up big numbers in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Houston also has a strong defense. They ranked third in the league in defensive rating this season. This means that they are able to hold their opponents to fewer points than average.</p>
<p>The Rockets will be facing a tough opponent in the Timberwolves. Minnesota was one of the surprise teams in the NBA this season, and they have a lot of young talent. However, I believe that Houston is just too good for Minnesota. I expect them to win in six games or less.</p>
<p>If you want to bet on the Rockets in the playoffs, there are a few different betting options that you can choose from. One option is to bet on who will win each individual game. You can also bet on how far Houston will advance in the playoffs. Additionally, you can bet on whether or not James Harden will win MVP honors at the end of the postseason.</p>
